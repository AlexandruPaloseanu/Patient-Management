Java application for the management of a medical enterprise. The application is made using Gradle and Java Swing, and makes use of Databases (SQL). I have made a short (9 min.) video presentation for the application. This can be viewed following the link: https://youtu.be/P_703i3Mfk0

The application has two types of users: patients and medics.

  A medic can:

1. log in to their account,
2. create an account in case they do not have one,
3. view a list with the patient sheets of their patients,
4. add a new patient sheet,
5. modify an existing patient sheet,
6. mark an appointment as done or not.

  A patient can:

1. log in to their accounts,
2. create an account in case they do not have one,
3. make an appointment,
4. modify an appointment,
5. view all their appointments,
6. view their patient sheets.
